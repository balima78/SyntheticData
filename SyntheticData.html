        Testing and validating applications or data products requires the use of data that is not always available to us. As an alternative to real data, we have the possibility to generate fake or synthetic data in a format similar to real data. This task view collects information on R packages including functionalities to generate synthetic data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_data">
          Wikipedia
        </a>
        defines synthetic data as follows: Synthetic data is &quot;any production data applicable to a given situation that are not obtained by direct measurement&quot; according to the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms; where Craig S. Mullins, an expert in data management, defines production data as &quot;information that is persistently stored and used by professionals to conduct business processes.&quot;

        This CRAN task view contains a list of packages that can be used to generate synthetic data. Also, several packages to deal with unbalanced data are listed.

        The development of this task view is fairly new and still in its early stages and therefore subject to changes. Suggestions for additions and extensions to the task view maintainer are welcomed.

    Tools and Tests for Experiments with Partially Synthetic Data Sets. A set of functions to support experimentation in the utility of partially synthetic data sets. All functions compare an observed data set to one or a set of partially synthetic data sets derived from the observed data to (1) check that data sets have identical attributes, (2) calculate overall and specific variable perturbation rates, (3) check for potential logical inconsistencies, and (4) calculate confidence intervals and standard errors of desired variables in multiple imputed data sets. Confidence interval and standard error formulas have options for either synthetic data sets or multiple imputed data sets (
